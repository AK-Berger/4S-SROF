## Step 1: Install Python

Before starting, make sure Python is installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. **Download Python**:  
   Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for your operating system.

2. **Install Python**:  
   - Run the downloaded installer.
   - Check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** before proceeding with the installation.
   - Follow the installation wizard and complete the setup.

3. **Verify Installation**:  
   Open a terminal or command prompt and type:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   If Python is installed correctly, you'll see the installed version number.

## Step 2: Install Anaconda

Anaconda is a comprehensive platform that simplifies working with Python and data science tools.

1. **Download Anaconda**:  
   Visit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and download the latest version for your operating system.

2. **Install Anaconda**:  
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - Choose to add Anaconda to your PATH (optional but recommended).

3. **Verify Installation**:  
   Open a terminal (or Anaconda Prompt) and type:
   ```bash
   conda --version
   ```
   You should see the installed version of Conda.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

To run the code, you need an IDE. We recommend **Jupyter Notebook**, which is included with Anaconda.

### Why Jupyter Notebook?  
Jupyter Notebook is a user-friendly, interactive environment perfect for running Python code and visualizing data.

### Steps to Open Jupyter Notebook:
If you installed Anaconda, you already have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can simply search for "Jupyter Notebook" in your operating system's search bar and open it. Once opened, a web browser will display the Jupyter Notebook dashboard where you can manage and run your notebooks.

## Step 4: Download the GitHub Repository

The code is hosted on GitHub. Follow these steps to download and use it:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:  
   - Navigate to the [code repository](https://github.com/shumaly/4S-SROF) and either click on **"Code" > "Download ZIP"** or clone the repository using:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```

2. **Save in an Easy-to-Find Location**:  
   - If you are using Jupyter Notebook, it's best to save the repository in:
     ```
     C:/Users/[your_admin_name]/
     ```
   - This ensures you can quickly access it from the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.

## Step 5: Open the Code in Jupyter Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

2. Navigate to the downloaded repository:
   - Go to the directory where you saved the GitHub repository (e.g., `C:/Users/[your_admin_name]/`).
   - Open the file named `Control Panel.ipynb`.

3. Run the Code:
   - Click on the first cell and press `Shift + Enter` to execute the code.
   - Proceed to run the rest of the cells in the notebook sequentially.
