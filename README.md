# Deep Learning to Analyze Sliding Drops ([Cite Us](#citation))

The 4S-SROF toolkit is trying to address existing problems to analyze drop sliding motion on a tilted plate. It helps researchers conduct detailed studies with a broad range of variables considering their correlations. The 4S-SROF is able to enlarge images by up-scale ratio 3 using a super-resolution model trained on a dataset containing 14000 images from sliding drops. Then, different criteria are extracted from super-resolution images. Measuring contact angles is performed by an optimized polynomial explained in the manuscript.

# Data Information

## Tutorial

- **File:** `tutorial.ipynb`

    This tutorial contains examples and outputs explaining how the toolkit works step-by-step. It is designed to help researchers understand each step and its parameters. A comprehensive example is provided at the end, demonstrating the extraction of all criteria from a high-speed camera video.

## Drop Profile Video

- **File:** `drop_profile.mp4`

    This video illustrates a sliding drop on a sample with a defect in the middle:

    - The **first drop** in the upper part of the video is the real drop image after preprocessing. Key preprocessing steps include:
      - Calculating the tilt angle and aligning frames horizontally.
      - Removing noise and background.
      - Detecting the drop position (marked by red lines).
    - The **second drop** (larger image) represents the drop after applying a super-resolution model.
    - Below that, the **drop contour** is extracted, and parameters such as contact angles (CAs), drop height, and drop length are displayed.
    - On the left, four plots analyze how the drop slides over a defected sample.

## Python Files

The following `.py` files are included in the toolkit and provide functions for related image processing tasks:

- `angle_detection.py`
- `baseline_detection.py`
- `criteria_definition.py`
- `edge_superres.py`
- `tools.py`
- `visualization.py`

These scripts are essential for researchers working with this toolkit.

## Samples

- **Description:** The `samples` folder contains two sliding drop examples. Pre-run outputs are included in `tutorial.ipynb`. 
- **Usage:** 
  - To re-run the tutorial, add the `samples` folder to your working directory.
  - Alternatively, replace the video frames with your own dataset.
