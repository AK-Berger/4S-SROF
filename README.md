# Deep Learning to Analyze Sliding Drops ([Cite Us](#citation))

The **4S-SROF toolkit** is designed to solve existing challenges in analyzing the sliding motion of drops on tilted plates. It enables researchers to conduct detailed studies by considering a wide range of variables and their correlations.

Key features include:
- **Super-Resolution Enhancement**: The toolkit enlarges images by an up-scale ratio of 3 using a super-resolution model trained on a dataset of 14,000 sliding drop images.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Extracts various criteria from the super-resolution images to provide precise insights into drop behavior.
- **Optimized Contact Angle Measurement**: Contact angles are measured using an optimized polynomial method, as described in the accompanying manuscript.

The 4S-SROF toolkit streamlines complex image processing tasks, empowering researchers with high-quality data for in-depth analysis.

# Data Information

## Drop Profile Video

- **File:** `drop_profile.mp4`

    This video illustrates a sliding drop on a sample with a defect in the middle:

    - The **first drop** in the upper part of the video is the real drop image after preprocessing. Key preprocessing steps include:
      - Calculating the tilt angle and aligning frames horizontally.
      - Removing noise and background.
      - Detecting the drop position (marked by red lines).
    - The **second drop** (larger image) represents the drop after applying a super-resolution model.
    - Below that, the **drop contour** is extracted, and parameters such as contact angles (CAs), drop height, and drop length are displayed.
    - On the left, four plots analyze how the drop slides over a defected sample.

## Instructions

- **File:** `instructions.md`  

    This file is a comprehensive guide designed to assist researchers in setting up and using the analysis toolkit. It has two general sections: one focused on setting up the environment and another on effectively using the code.

    - **How to Set Up:**  
      This section guides you through the installation of Python, Anaconda, and Jupyter Notebook. It explains how to download the code repository, prepare your working directory, and ensure all necessary libraries are installed for a seamless setup.  

    - **How to Use:**  
      This section provides detailed steps for preparing video frames, creating and marking the slope folder, and running the analysis code. It also explains how to configure experiment-specific variables and interpret the generated outputs, such as `result.xlsx` and analyzed frame outputs.

## Control Panel

- **File:** `Control Panel.ipynb`  

    This file contains the main executable code for the toolkit. It acts as a central hub, calling other `.py` files and libraries to perform the analysis. The code processes the video frames, extracts features, and generates the final `result.xlsx` file containing the analyzed time-series data. It integrates all steps of the workflow, making it easy to convert raw video frames into meaningful results.

## PFOTS Sample with a Defect

- **Files:** `PFOTS sample with a defect.zip.001 - .007`  

    These files contain a sample of sliding drop video frame examples that have been processed using the code, including results from all steps of the analysis. You can use this sample to try the code and gain a better understanding of how it works. It serves as a practical example to help you learn more about the workflow and outputs of the analysis toolkit.

# Python Environment Setup Guide

Open **Anaconda Prompt**, **Command Prompt (cmd)**, or **Terminal** to execute the following commands.

Install Python 3.11.7.

To create a new virtual environment named `myenv` manually, run:

```sh
python -m venv myenv
```

To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

For Windows:

```sh
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS/Linux:

```sh
source myenv/bin/activate
```

To install the dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`, use:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To enable the virtual environment for Jupyter Notebook, install the `ipykernel` package:

```sh
pip install ipykernel
```

To register the virtual environment as a kernel in Jupyter Notebook, run:

```sh
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"
```

To start Jupyter Notebook, run:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

Open a new notebook, navigate to **Kernel â†’ Change Kernel**, and select **"Python (myenv)"** from the list.
